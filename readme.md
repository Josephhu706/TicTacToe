Approach Taken

Since i knew i didn't have too much time, i wanted to make something that i was passionate about to keep up motivation and something that might cover up some of the ...jankness of the project. I thought sprite based animation in a 2d fighting game style would work well. This would help mask the choppiness of some animations i wanted to include and cringe sounds i wanted to play and make it more fun.

During the project

As this was my first project, I was caught up in thinking too far ahead with where I wanted my project to go. Very often i would go down a rabbit hole and lose track ot the whole project. I would design my code a certain way and then when i would add to it, redundancies would pop up that i didn't forsee or bugs would occur for parts of my application that i didn't think would interact.

Making the best out of it

Most importantly i wanted the game to be fun. I did realise along the way a lot of my code was a bit WET and had to change parts of it. Making the sound work was a huge pain. I wanted it to autoplay as soon as i loaded the page but realised after 3 hours that chrome disabled that feature. I spent a lot of time photoshopping gifs and icons to make them look nicer. It was also difficult tying the reset and next button functions with the character select screen.

Many WET aspects of my code came about when i started to add more character options for the game. I realised well into my project that i could have reduced a lot of repetition by building my code around the characters as a group rather than individually. I used some loops to solve some of these problems but due to time constraint i didn't resolve all of them.

In the end i think i was happy with what i accomplished in only a few days. It's certainly not perfect and there are still things to iron out but it is a functional and stylish game.

Unsolved Problems

Getting the code to work without hardcoding the X's and O's in my winning conditionals.
Futher below are unsolved problems due to time constraints:

making animations and sound transition more smoothly when the player interacts with something.
Reducing redundancies in code and making it more efficient.
Formatting the game to fit on browser/phone
